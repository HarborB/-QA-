This task is a UI/UX refinement only.
DO NOT change any existing features, logic, validation rules, or data handling.

CONTEXT
This is an internal web-based QA tool used by:
- QA engineers
- AI engineers
- Technical product reviewers

They use it frequently, quickly, and rationally.
The UI should feel calm, precise, and trustworthy — not flashy.

GOAL
Improve the visual design and user experience so the interface feels:
- Simple
- High-end
- Professional
- Easy to scan for structure-related issues

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Minimalist, information-dense, and distraction-free
- Neutral color palette (grays, soft whites, muted accents)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Generous spacing and alignment
- Subtle emphasis only where it improves clarity

DO NOT:
- Add animations
- Add new features
- Change copy meaning
- Reorganize data structure
- Introduce heavy UI frameworks

SPECIFIC UI IMPROVEMENTS TO APPLY

1. Layout
- Center content with a reasonable max-width (e.g. ~1100–1200px)
- Increase vertical spacing between major sections
- Ensure consistent margins and padding

2. Typography
- Use a clean system font stack or a modern sans-serif
- Clear hierarchy:
  - Page title: strong, confident
  - Section headers: calm and distinct
  - Table text: compact, highly readable
- Avoid decorative fonts

3. Input Area (Textarea)
- Make it visually distinct as the primary input
- Use subtle background contrast
- Rounded corners, soft border
- Clear placeholder styling
- Comfortable line height for pasted JSON

4. Primary Action Button
- One clear primary action
- Solid, muted accent color (not loud)
- Rounded corners
- Strong visual affordance without being aggressive

5. Validation / Status Section
- Visually separate validation results from the table
- Use subtle color coding:
  - Green for “no issues”
  - Muted yellow/orange for warnings
  - Soft red for errors
- Avoid harsh alerts or flashing styles

6. Table Styling
- Improve readability:
  - Clear column alignment
  - Subtle row separators
  - Slight row hover highlight (optional)
- Keep it compact but not cramped
- Make structural columns (Clause Number, Path) easy to scan
- Ensure long titles wrap cleanly without breaking layout

7. Overall Feel
- The UI should feel like an internal tool at a high-quality tech company
- Prioritize clarity, trust, and efficiency over visual decoration
- If unsure, choose the more restrained option

DELIVERABLE
- Only adjust HTML/CSS (and minimal JS if required for styling)
- Preserve all existing functionality exactly as-is
