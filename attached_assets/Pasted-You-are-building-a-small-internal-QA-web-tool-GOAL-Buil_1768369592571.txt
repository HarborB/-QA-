You are building a small internal QA web tool.

GOAL
Build a lightweight web application to help testers quickly validate the quality of AI-extracted document clause structures.
The problem is that the extracted JSON contains very long clause_content fields, making it hard to visually inspect whether the structural extraction is correct.

The tool must compress the output and surface only structural information so testers can assess correctness at a glance.

TECH STACK
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: simple HTML + minimal JS (no heavy frameworks)
- This is an internal testing tool, not production-facing

INPUT
- The UI must provide a large text input (textarea)
- Testers will manually copy-paste AI-extracted clause data into the textarea
- The pasted content is typically a JSON array of objects, each object representing one clause
- No file upload is required

Each clause object may contain fields like:
- clause_number (string, e.g. "2.7.3", "3", "3.1.")
- clause_title (string, may be empty)
- clause_page (string or number, may be empty)
- clause_content (very long text — MUST be ignored in output)
- clause_path (array of strings, e.g. ["2", "2.7", "2.7.3"])
- clause_level, clause_parent (optional, not required for display)

OUTPUT (CORE REQUIREMENT)
After submission, render a compact table directly in the web page with ONLY these columns:

| Clause Number | Clause Title | Clause Page | Clause Path |

Rules:
- clause_content must NEVER be shown
- The table is the primary output (no downloads)

VALIDATION CHECKS (IMPORTANT)
In addition to the table, compute and display a small summary of structural issues to help testers evaluate extraction quality:

1. Clause number continuity
   - Normalize clause_number (remove trailing dots like "3.")
   - Use clause_path to determine hierarchy
   - Within the same parent path, check whether sibling clause numbers increment sequentially
   - Flag gaps or jumps as "potential missing clauses"

2. Missing or empty clause titles
   - clause_title is empty or whitespace-only

3. Missing or invalid clause pages
   - clause_page is empty or non-numeric

The tool does NOT need to understand document semantics — only structural consistency.

UX REQUIREMENTS
- One-page interface
- Textarea → Submit button → Results below
- Results include:
  - Issue summary (lists of detected problems)
  - The compact clause table
- Design can be minimal and utilitarian (testing-focused)

ROBUSTNESS
- Assume input may be messy but generally valid JSON
- Gracefully handle parse errors with clear error messages
- Ignore any unknown fields

DELIVERABLE
- A runnable FastAPI app
- Prefer a single-file or very small file structure
- Clear, readable code
- Prioritize correctness over visual polish
